/*A function countAndSay is defined as:
countAndSay(1) = “1”
countAndSay(n) is the way you would "say" the digit string from countAndSay(n-1), which is then
converted into a different digit string.
So, if sample input is n = 4,
countAndSay(1) = 1
countAndSay(2) = “one 1” => 11
countAndSay(3) = “two 1” => 21
countAndSay(4) = “one 2 one 1” => 1211*/
