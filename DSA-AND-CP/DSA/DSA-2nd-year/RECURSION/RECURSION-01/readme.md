This portion was supposed to be the very basics of recursion which includes
--------- Intro to recursion
--------- call stack
--------- printing from n to 1 natural numbers
--------- printing from 1 to n using a parameter
--------- printing from 1 to n without using a parameter
--------- finding factorial and sum upto n terms using recursioon
--------- Time and space complexity of the recursion which is obviously not better than iterative approach
--------------- Some basics questions you can try---------
--------- Make a function which calculates 'a' raised to the power of 'b' using recursion
